# Valid for all experiments whose run number are equal or larger than the suffix of this file.

# If more than one config file satisfy a run, the one with a suffix number that is closest to the run is used:
# e.g. if both eqsans_configuration.100 and  eqsans_configuration.120 and exist, then for run # 121,eqsans_configuration.120 is the valid one.
